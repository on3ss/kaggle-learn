# Machine Learning Learning Repository

This repository contains code and resources for learning machine learning through a free course available on Kaggle. The course covers various topics in machine learning, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

## Course Overview

The Kaggle course provides a comprehensive introduction to machine learning concepts and techniques. It includes hands-on coding exercises, real-world datasets, and practical examples to help you grasp key concepts effectively. Throughout the course, you'll learn:

- Basics of Python programming for machine learning
- Data preprocessing techniques such as data cleaning, feature scaling, and feature engineering
- Supervised learning algorithms including linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests
- Unsupervised learning techniques like clustering and dimensionality reduction
- Model evaluation and validation methods
- Techniques for improving model performance
- Introduction to deep learning and neural networks

## Folder Structure

- **notebooks/**: Contains Jupyter notebooks for each lesson or exercise in the course.
- **datasets/**: Stores datasets used in the exercises and examples.
- **resources/**: Additional resources such as slides, PDFs, or supplementary materials provided in the course.
